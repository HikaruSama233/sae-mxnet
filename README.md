# sae-mxnet

A python implementation for "Semantic Autoencoder for Zero-Shot Learning"

Inspired by https://github.com/hoseong-kim/sae-pytorch

Use raw images and semantic features from AwA2 dataset instead of .mat file.

Use Res101 pretrained model from mxnet for image feature extraction.

When HITK=1, the accuracy will be 80.97%
